<strong><h1>A Brief Introduction</h1></strong>
<p>
    <b>The Orthodox Tewahedo Church is a term used to refer to the Oriental Orthodox Churches of Ethiopia and Eritrea. They share a common faith and liturgy, but have separate hierarchies and administrations. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is the largest of the Oriental Orthodox Churches, with between 36 million and 49.8 million adherents in Ethiopia. It traces its origins to the 4th century, when Christianity was made the state religion of the Kingdom of Aksum by King Ezana. The Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church is one of the youngest autocephalous churches, having gained its independence from the Ethiopian church in 1993, after Eritrea became a sovereign state. It has about 2.5 million members in Eritrea.
    The Orthodox Tewahedo Church is an ancient and vibrant Christian community that traces its roots to Ethiopia. <br>

    <ul>
        <li>It is one of the oldest Christian churches in the world, dating back to the first century CE, when the Ethiopian eunuch was baptized by Philip the Evangelist. This event is recorded in the book of Acts in the Bible, and is considered the first conversion of an African to Christianity. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ethiopian-Orthodox-Tewahedo-Church">read more</a><br>
        </li>
        <li>It became officially established in the fourth century CE, when St. Frumentius and his brother Aedesius converted the king of Aksum and made Christianity the state religion. St. Frumentius was later consecrated as the first bishop of Ethiopia by Athanasius of Alexandria, the defender of orthodox Christianity against Arianism.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrean_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church">read more</a></li>

    <li>They believe in the one single unified nature of Christ, which is both human and divine. This is called miaphysitism, and it differs from the two-nature doctrine of most other Christian churches. The word tewahedo means “unity” and expresses this belief.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Tewahedo">read more</a></li>
    <li>The church professes belief in the seven sacraments of baptism, confirmation, eucharist, confession, the anointing of the sick, matrimony, and holy orders.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Tewahedo">read more</a></li>
    <li>The church blends Christian conceptions of saints and angels with pre-Christian beliefs in benevolent and malevolent spirits and imps.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Tewahedo">read more</a></li>
    <li>The church places considerable emphasis on the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament).<a target="_blank"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Tewahedo">read more</a></li>
    <li>The church uses the Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon, which includes books not found in other Christian canons.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Tewahedo">read more</a></li>
    <li>The church follows the Alexandrian liturgy, which is based on the Coptic liturgy and uses Geʽez as the liturgical language.<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ethiopian-Orthodox-Tewahedo-Church">read more</a></li>

<p class="recent">
    <strong>
The Coptic and Ethiopian Orthodox Churches reached an agreement on July 13, 1948, that led to autocephaly for the Church of Ethiopia. Five bishops were immediately consecrated by the Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria, empowered to elect a new patriarch for their church. It was also agreed that the successor to Archbishop Abuna Qerilos IV, a Copt, would have the power to consecrate new bishops. This promotion was completed when Coptic Pope Yosab of Alexandria consecrated an Ethiopian-born bishop, Abune Basilyos, on January 14, 1951. Then in 1959 Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria enthroned Abune Basilyos as the first Patriarch of Ethiopia.

Patriarch Abune Basilyos died in 1971 and was succeeded that year by Patriarch Abune Tewoflos. With the fall of Emperor Haile Silase in 1974 the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church was disestablished as the state church. The new Marxist government began nationalizing property (including land) owned by the Church and in 1976 Abune Tewoflos was arrested by the Communist Derg regime. He was secretly executed later that year. The government subsequently ordered the Church to elect a new patriarch and a simple monk from the countryside, Abune Tekle Haimanot II, was enthroned. The Coptic Orthodox Church refused to recognize the election and enthronement of Abune Tekle Haimanot on the grounds that the Holy Synod of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church had not removed Abune Tewoflos and that the government had not publicly acknowledged his death, and that he was thus still the legitimate patriarch of Ethiopia. Formal relations between the two churches were stopped, although they remained in communion with each other, and were resumed on July 13, 2007.<a href="https://orthodoxwiki.org/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church#cite_note-1">read more</a>


Archbishop Anastasios of Albania visits with Abune P'awlos at the 2008 Central Committee meeting of the World Council of Churches<img class="move"src="https://commons.orthodoxwiki.org/images/thumb/a/a0/AnastasiosAndPaulos.JPG/350px-AnastasiosAndPaulos.JPG"alt="meating of the 2 bishopes"width="200px">Patriarch Abune Tekle Haimanot proved to be much less accommodating to the Derg regime than it had expected, and so when the patriarch died in 1988 a new patriarch with closer ties to the regime was sought. Archbishop Abune Merqoriyos of Gonder, a member of the Derg-era Ethiopian Parliament, was therefore elected and enthroned as patriarch. Following the fall of the Derg regime in 1991 and the coming to power of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), Patriarch Abune Merqoriyos abdicated under governmental pressure and was replaced by the new government's candidate, Abune P'awlos.

Following the enthronement of Abune P'awlos, Abune Merqoriyos fled abroad, first to Kenya and later to the United States, and announced that his abdication had been forced and that he was therefore the legitimate Patriarch of Ethiopia. Several other archbishops also went into exile in 1992 and together with Abune Merqoriyos and an Ethiopian Orthodox archbishop in the Caribbean formed the Holy Synod in Exile of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. This Synod in Exile is recognized by a number of Ethiopian Orthodox churches in Kenya, North America, Western Europe, and Australia that do not recognize the legitimacy of Abune P'awlos' election as patriarch.

After Eritrea became an independent country the Coptic Orthodox Church granted autocephaly to the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church with the reluctant approval of its mother, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church. Unliek the Church of Ethiopia, the Church of Eritrea is only in practice partially autocephalous due to the nature of the agreement on communion between it and the Coptic Orthodox Church.

As of 2005 there are many Ethiopian Orthodox churches located throughout the United States and other countries to which Ethiopians have migrated. Roughly 40% of Ethiopia, around 35 million people, are members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.
